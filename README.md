# Hip-Hop-Album-Web-Scrapper

_A web scrapper that scraps all of the hip hop
albums realeased (according to wikipedia) from
1980 - 2016._

The scrapper as of right now gets the
album name, date released, artist name, and downloads the album cover
(if one is availabe)

## Requirements

In order for the scrapper to work
you must have a **directory called
album_covers**. This folder will store
all of the album cover photos downloaded from the album wiki page.

Also, there must be a directory called
album_data that stores empty json files for each album year. In this folder there is are files called 1980.json, 1981.json, 1982.json, etc.

I'm have been working on this for a while but now that I'm pushing it to github I'm going to work on making it more efficient. Hopefully with some outside input as well.
